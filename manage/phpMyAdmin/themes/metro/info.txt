Windows 8 / Metro Theme for phpMyAdmin 2.0

This is a minimalistic, clean theme for phpMyAdmin 3.5 and above, inspired by Windows 8.
The second version contains bug fixes and a clearer layout.
Tested under Firefox 17, Chrome 23, Safari 5.1.7, Opera 12.12 and Internet Explorer 9 & 10.
Using this theme under any earlier version of browsers listed above may cause erroneous appearance. Such browsers like Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8 are definitely not recommended for this theme.
This theme has several color schemes. To switch between schemes, read layout.inc for further instructions.

Note: for better visual performance, the frameset system, layered in index.php is modified. Creating a backup file of index.php is recommended.
