  one, the number visitors to your site increases.  Most people have their browsers
  set to display 10 results per page so if you are not in the top 20 or 30, they 
  usually won\'t get to your site.');
  define('TEXT_RANK', 'Page Rank (PR) is a measure of how many links there are to a 
  page on your site.  Each page will have its own PR.  Note that PR is wholly
  determined by the number of links to your page - nothing else. So the more 
  links you can generate (with link exchanges, posting your url on forums and even
  links within your own site) the higher your PR will be.');
  define('TEXT_LINKPOP', 'Link Popularity (LP) is very similar to Page Rank except 
  it goes a little further. Actually, Page Rank is a subset of Link Popularity. 
  Where PR is mainly determined by the number of links to a page, LP
  figures in the relevance of those links.  If you sell Widgets and all other 
  Widget sites are linking to you then the search engines figure that your site
  must be the one to watch and will give you extra points for that.');
  define('TEXT_DENSITY', 'Keyword Density (KD) is a ratio of your chosen keyword(s)
  to the total number of words on the page.  A KD of around 6% is considered a 
  good figure.  If you go too low, the SE\'s will not rank you as high. But if
  you go too high, they may think that you are spamming.');
  define('TEXT_CHECK_LINKS', 'Having working code is an important part of SEO.
  If a search engine bot cannot follow a link, it is unlikely that it will list
  it.  Having working links is also important to your visitors. If they can\'t
  find their way around your site, they, like the search engine bots, will 
  usually just go away.');
